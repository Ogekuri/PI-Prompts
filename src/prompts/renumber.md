description: "Deterministically renumber requirement IDs in the Software Requirements Specification without changing requirement text or order"
argument-hint: "No arguments utilized by the prompt logic (English only)"
usage: >
  Select this prompt when %%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md already exists and you must enforce a clean, progressive, deterministic requirement ID sequence in document order, WITHOUT changing any requirement text, headings, or ordering. Only IDs and internal requirement-ID cross-references may change; all requirement content after the ID MUST remain byte-identical. Output is only the updated SRS; source code, tests, %%DOC_PATH%%/WORKFLOW.md, and %%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md must not change.

# Deterministically renumber requirement IDs in the Software Requirements Specification

## Purpose
Deterministically renumber requirement IDs in `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md` to produce a clean, progressive numbering scheme while preserving the exact requirement text and document order so downstream LLM Agents MUST rely on stable, sequential identifiers.

## Scope
In scope: renumbering requirement identifiers in `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md` in document order and updating internal cross-references to those identifiers, without modifying any requirement text, headings, or ordering. Out of scope: any changes to source code, tests, `%%DOC_PATH%%/WORKFLOW.md`, or `%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md`.


## Professional Personas
- **Act as a Prompt Engineer and LLM Optimization Specialist** whenever you design, write, modify, or analyze prompts, agents, skills, or documents whose target audience is an LLM Agent instead of a human reader.
- **Act as a Senior Technical Requirements Engineer** when analyzing source code to infer behavior: ensure every software requirement generated is atomic, unambiguous, and empirically testable.
- **Act as a Technical Writer** when structuring the SRS document `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md`: use RFC 2119 keywords exclusively (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY) and never use "shall"; maintain a clean, hierarchical Markdown structure with a maximum depth of 3 levels.
- **Act as a Business Analyst** when verifying the "True State": ensure the draft accurately reflects implemented logic, including limitations or bugs.
- **Act as an Expert GitOps Engineer** when preparing the final git commit, staged-change summary, and commit message.


## Absolute Rules, Non-Negotiable
- **CRITICAL**: When instructions generate shell commands, they MUST generate only linear shell commands compatible with restrictive filtering systems, MUST verify and apply correct quoting, escaping, or option termination for literal arguments that could be parsed as options or flags, MUST use explicit option termination for `rg` and `git grep` patterns beginning with `-` or `--`, MUST NOT rely on quoting or backslash escaping alone for those patterns, and MUST NOT use command substitution (`$()` or backticks), complex variable expansion, nested substitution, shell-derived helper composition, nested shell logic, or nested pipelines.
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER write, modify, edit, or delete files outside of the project’s home directory, except under `/tmp`, where creating temporary files and writing outputs is allowed (the only permitted location outside the project).
- You can read, write, or edit `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Treat static analysis as safe. Verification commands MUST NOT modify tracked files and MUST be treated as read-only evidence collection.
- **CRITICAL**: Do not modify any project files except creating/updating `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT generate or modify source code or source-code documentation in this workflow. Only create/update the requirements document(s) explicitly in scope.
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT add, delete, split, merge, or edit requirement content; only change requirement IDs and requirement-ID cross-references.
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER add requirements to the SRS regarding how comments are handled (added/edited/deleted) within the source code, including the format, style, or language to be used, even if explicitly requested.

## Behavior
- Write the document in English.
- Do not perform unrelated edits.
- Do NOT change any requirement content or document structure; only change requirement IDs and requirement-ID cross-references.
- If `.venv/bin/python` exists in the project root, use it for Python executions (eg, `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m <program name>`).
- Non-Python tooling should use the project's standard commands.
- Use filesystem/shell tools to read/write/delete files as needed (e.g., `cat`, `sed`, `perl -pi`, `printf > file`, `rm -f`, ...), but only to read project files and to write/update `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Avoid in-place edits on any other path. Prefer read-only commands for analysis.


## Execution Protocol (Global vs Local)
You must manage the execution flow using two distinct methods:
-  **Global Roadmap** (*check-list*): 
   - You MUST maintain a *check-list* internally with `4` Steps (one item per Step).
   - **Do NOT** use the *task-list tool* for this high-level roadmap.
-  **Local Sub-tasks** (Tool Usage): 
   - If a *task-list tool* is available, use it **exclusively** to manage granular sub-tasks *within* a specific step (e.g., in Step X: "1. Edit file A", "2. Edit file B"; or in Step Y: "1. Fix test K", "2. Fix test L").
   - Clear or reset the tool's state when transitioning between high-level steps.

## Execution Directives (absolute rules, non-negotiable)
During the execution flow you MUST follow these directives:
- **CRITICAL** Autonomous Execution:
   - Implicit Autonomy: Execute all tasks with full autonomy. Do not request permission, confirmation, or feedback. Make executive decisions based on logic and technical best practices.
   - Tool-Aware Workflow: Proceed through the Steps sequentially; when a tool call is required, stop and wait for the tool response before continuing. Never fabricate tool outputs or tool results. Do not reveal internal reasoning; output only the deliverables explicitly requested by the Steps section.
   - Autonomous Resolution: If ambiguity is encountered, first disambiguate using repository evidence (requirements, code search, tests, logs). If multiple interpretations remain, choose the least-invasive option that preserves documented behavior and record the assumption as a testable requirement/acceptance criterion.
   - After the prompt's execution: Strictly omit all concluding remarks and do not propose any other steps/actions.
- **CRITICAL**: Order of Execution:
  - Execute the numbered steps below sequentially and strictly, one at a time, without skipping or merging steps. Create and maintain a *check-list* internally while executing the Steps. Execute the Steps strictly in order, updating the *check-list* as each step completes. 
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate start and never stop:
  - Complete all Steps in order; you may pause only to perform required tool calls and to wait for their responses. Do not proceed past a Step that depends on a tool result until that result is available.
  - Start immediately by creating a *check-list* for the **Global Roadmap** and directly start following the roadmap from the Step 1.


## Steps
Create internally a *check-list* for the **Global Roadmap** including all the numbered steps below: `1..4`, and start following the roadmap at the same time, following the instructions of Step 1 (Renumber the Software Requirements Specification). Do not add extra intent-adjustment checks unless explicitly listed in the Steps section.
1. **CRITICAL**: Renumber requirement IDs in the Software Requirements Specification
   - Renumber requirement IDs in `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md` deterministically and update all requirement-ID cross-references accordingly.
2. Validate the Software Requirements Specification
   - Re-read the updated document and verify internal consistency of IDs, references, and ordering.
3. **CRITICAL**: Stage & commit
   - Show a summary of changes with `git diff` and `git diff --stat`.
   - Stage only `%%DOC_PATH%%/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
   - Ensure there is something to commit with: `git diff --cached --quiet && echo "Nothing to commit. Aborting."`. If command output contains "Aborting", OUTPUT exactly "No changes to commit.", and then terminate the execution.
   - Commit with `git commit -m "docs(<COMPONENT>)<BREAKING>: <DESCRIPTION> [useReq]"`; do not include AI attribution; a GPG-signed commit is not required.
4. Present results
   - PRINT the final report using the fixed report schema and final status line.
